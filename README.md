SO here is my contribution to Dugree. First and for most, My model should not be used until there are alot of transcripts
I would say at least 10-15 debate transcripts from launch to ensure proper training. The issue im having is that debates
are very nuanced and data lead to data leakage "training both sides but both sides get the same data injected. For example,
conversations that don't have any real data that can be used like "your points are valid where you say {here}". So! in the mean-time I provided you with 2 llm models that
I think you can use in place. GPT-4 if you want to you use it you need there API key. and LLAMA! Even after this internship
if you need any help please contact me with anything!

Here is an overview of my model.
Overview:
This code uses a BERT model for classifying debate transcripts into ideologies such as Pro-Palestinian or Pro-Israeli. The code addresses some key issues like data labeling, class imbalance, and exporting the trained model to ONNX for optimized inference.

Detailed Explanation of Key Sections:
1. Data Loading and Labeling
Debate Data: The function load_debate_data reads from a file and labels sentences based on the speaker’s identity. It assumes that certain speakers are always Pro-Israeli or Pro-Palestinian, which is a good starting point for labeling but may need more nuance (e.g., based on statement content rather than speaker identity).

Predefined Statements: Similarly, load_predefined_statements loads labeled sentences from a file with explicit labels like "Pro-Palestine" or "Pro-Israeli." This dataset complements the debate data, helping the model learn from explicit cases.

2. Tokenization:
The BERT tokenizer is used to transform text into tokenized input suitable for the model. You map this function over the dataset, padding/truncating the inputs to a max length of 128 tokens.

3. Model and Class Weights:
You’re using the BertForSequenceClassification model with two labels (Pro-Palestinian and Pro-Israeli).
Class weights are defined but currently balanced ([1.0, 1.0]). If there’s an imbalance in your data (e.g., more Pro-Israeli than Pro-Palestinian), you can adjust these weights accordingly to avoid bias during training.
4. Loss Function:
The weighted_loss function is defined to compute the loss with the specified class weights. It's based on the CrossEntropyLoss from PyTorch.

5. Training Arguments:
The training is set up with early stopping (patience of 2 epochs) and model regularization using weight decay (0.01) to avoid overfitting.
Evaluation Strategy: You’re saving and evaluating the model at each epoch, which ensures that you get the best-performing model at the end.
6. Metrics:
You compute common classification metrics: accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, using the precision_recall_fscore_support function from sklearn.

7. Trainer API:
Hugging Face’s Trainer class is used to handle the training loop, saving models, and evaluation. It’s designed to make fine-tuning models easy, and you have integrated data collation and early stopping.

8. Model Saving and ONNX(GROQ) Export:
After training, the model is saved using save_pretrained to allow for easy reuse.

The model is then exported to the ONNX format, which is optimized for serving and inference on different hardware backends (like CPUs, GPUs, or specialized hardware). This will allow Dugree to deploy the model efficiently in production.
Additions You Can Consider:
1. Handling Neutral Class:
Right now, you only have two classes: Pro-Palestinian and Pro-Israeli. If you want to classify "Neutral" statements as well, you’ll need to update:

Model: Change num_labels=2 to num_labels=3 in the BertForSequenceClassification model.
Labels: You need to add a label 2 for neutral statements in your dataset, wherever appropriate.
This will make your model more adaptable to debates where some statements are not strongly aligned with either ideology.

2. Data Augmentation:
To reduce the risk of overfitting, especially with a small dataset, you can implement data augmentation techniques like paraphrasing, back-translation, or adding noise to your dataset. This will help the model generalize better when it encounters new debate transcripts.

3. Cross-Validation:
To ensure model robustness, consider using cross-validation during training. This splits the data into multiple folds and trains the model multiple times, ensuring the model performs well across different subsets of the data.

4. Experiment with Class Imbalance:
If you notice any class imbalance between Pro-Palestinian and Pro-Israeli statements, adjust your class_weights accordingly. For example, if Pro-Palestinian statements are underrepresented, you can assign a higher weight to that class.


class_weights = torch.tensor([1.5, 1.0, 1.2]).to('cuda')  # Adjusted for imbalance
5. Incorporating Contextual Information:
Debates often rely on context from previous statements. To capture this, you could modify your model to consider multiple sentences or statements at once (like a sequence-to-sequence classification or hierarchical model). This can give the model better understanding of the full flow of conversation.

6. Post-Processing Predictions:
After the model predicts the ideology of individual statements, you can apply smoothing techniques to ensure consistent predictions for a given speaker. For example, if a speaker predominantly makes Pro-Israeli statements, it’s unlikely that they would switch suddenly to Pro-Palestinian.

7. Serving the Model:
Once you have the ONNX export, you can serve the model using frameworks like ONNX Runtime for faster inference. This could be integrated into Dugree’s platform to run classifications on new transcripts in real-time or batch processes.

With enhancements like handling the neutral class, cross-validation, and better class balancing, the model can become more robust. Using ONNX for deployment ensures it will run efficiently in production, allowing you to process real-world debate transcripts as they accumulate.
